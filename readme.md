GenAI Cyber Incident Reporting System

A FastAPI-based, industry-ready cybersecurity incident analysis and reporting system that converts raw security logs into structured incident reports with severity scoring and PDF export, designed for SOC (Security Operations Center) workflows.

⚠️ This system generates draft reports only and follows a human-in-the-loop model for safety and compliance.

🚀 Problem Statement (SIH / Industry Context)

Security Operations Centers (SOCs) receive large volumes of heterogeneous logs (firewall, authentication, phishing alerts).
Manually correlating these logs and writing incident reports is:

Time-consuming

Error-prone

Inconsistent across analysts

This delays incident response and impacts investigation quality.

💡 Solution Overview

This project provides an automated cyber incident reporting backend that:

Correlates multiple security logs

Classifies incident type

Calculates severity using rule-based logic

Generates structured, professional incident reports

Exports reports as PDF for audits and compliance

The system is offline-capable, secure, and deployable in restricted environments.

✨ Key Features

🔍 Log Correlation Engine
Correlates firewall logs, authentication failures, and phishing alerts.

⚠️ Severity Scoring Logic
Rule-based classification (Low / Medium / High).

🧠 GenAI-Style Report Generation (Offline)
Produces human-readable incident summaries without external APIs.

🌐 FastAPI Backend
REST API with Swagger UI for easy testing and integration.

📄 PDF Export
One-click export of incident reports for SOC workflows.

🔐 Human-in-the-Loop Design
No automated enforcement actions — analyst review required.

🏆 Why This Project Stands Out

✔ Industry-usable backend
✔ SIH-ready problem statement
✔ Realistic SOC design
✔ Clean, professional API
✔ Not a toy or demo project
